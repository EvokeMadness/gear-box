# "Gear Box"

![](cover.png)
ID: A picture of a small box in the shape of a gear. It is blue and has a mirror in the center of the gear. It sits on the top of a wooden bookshelf and is in front of a map.

### Summary

A gear that functions as a box! This box measures roughly 110 mm x 110 mm x 40 mm and is in the shape of a gear.

In place of the shaft is a mirror that artistically simulates a hole passing through the box. The two sides of the box are held together by magnets. (Perhaps some left over from a Voron Klicky Probe?)

This model was made from the DXF file I used to create a logo for my college's engineering club. I really liked the proportions and thought it looked good as a physical item. I later turned it into a box to hold my many other printed gears from various projects.

## Print Settings

- Select the model which best fits your magnet size. (Print two (2) gear halves of the same size. See notes below in the next section for help selecting the correct model.)
- Print without supports.
- Print individually. (One half per print.)
- Print with 20% infill.
- Set Bottom fill pattern to Archimedean Chords.

## Bill of Materials

- Two circle mirrors 1.5" - 2.75" in diameter
- At least two magnets. (See note below for correct sizes.)
- Permanent adhesive
- Adhesive putty

### Notes

- Two models are provided and are labeled '6 mm' and '7 mm' accordingly. This refers to the diameter of the hole in which your magnets rest. If you are using leftover magnets from a Klicky Probe mod, I suggest that you use the '6 mm' variant. However, it is still best for you to confirm the actual diameter of your magnets.

## Assembly

- After printing each gear half, place both halves with the open side facing up.
- Orient both gears to where one spur from each gear is touching flat against the other.
- Add glue to the holes spanning from left to right. (There should be four (4) holes total.)
- Place one magnet in each hole containing glue. Position each magnet in the center of each hole. (This is important to best align each gear half.)
- Do not connect the gear halves until the glue completely dries.
- Roll the adhesive putty so that its length measures 150 mm. Shape the adhesive putty roll into a ring by connecting each end. Do this for a total of two (2) times.
- Adhere the putty to the reflective side of the mirror at an even distance from the center of the mirror. Do this for both mirrors.
- Attach a mirror to each gear half by firmly pressing the mirror assembly into the center of each gear half. This won't take any time to set.

## Optional

- Line the inside of each gear half assembly with batting, felt, or even tool drawer liner. Provided with the model is an SVG file with the pattern for this use.
- Replace the mirrors with a different material like something transparent, or a 3D-printed disk in a differing filament.

## Warnings

Glass, including mirrors, do not mix well with nuts, bolts, and other small metal masses. If you're planning on using this box to hold any of these items, make sure to line both sides of the gear halves to prevent any unexpected breaking of the glass sides.

## A note from the designer

Hey! Thanks for checking out my design, and I hope you have a good time with it. If you've printed and assembled this design, I'd love to see it. Post a make of this model to the Printables page assembled and sitting on a workbench, desk, or bookshelf. (You can set the box on its teeth or on one side.) If you have any issues with the original model, please let me know, and you can even open an issue on this model's [GitHub](https://github.com/EvokeMadness/gear-box) page. If you have any suggestions for variants of this model, please leave a comment, and I also want to encourage remixes of this design. The source files for this design can be found on its [GitHub](https://github.com/EvokeMadness/gear-box) page.

Happy printing!
